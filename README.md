# GCI

GCI (**G**o **C**ontinuous **I**ntegration) is a build and CI system build specifically for Go projects. By default, all build tasks are done inside of Docker containers, so everything is consistent across machines.

The only dependencies for using gci are a working Docker installation and the `gci` binary installed.
